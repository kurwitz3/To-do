# My ToDo App
*Front end code 
*[Back end here](https://github.com/kurwitz3/to-do-backend)

## Description

This is a cool little app that I use to keep track of things I need to accomplish. I used a Rails api backend so I can add and delete items after I have completed a task.

## Usage
To open in the browser run 
```bash
open index.html
```
You will also need to start the server in the backend. Instructions are located in the backend README.md.
